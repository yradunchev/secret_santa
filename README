# Secret Santa

A script to create Secret Santa derangement for N number of people.   
Takes one argument: number of people paritcipating.   
Prints out a derangement from that number.   

You can send script output to a file, print that file and cut it.   
Fold pieces so it's not visible what is written on them.   
Put pieces in a hat and ask people to pick a piece.   
Print a list form 1 to N and ask everyone to write his name against   
the number he got from the hat. Hang the list in the Office rest area.   
This way everyone will know to whom they should buy a present but
won't know who will buy them a present.
